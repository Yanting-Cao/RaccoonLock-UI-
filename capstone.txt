After finding out how the hardware and the main software works, let me describe the method we used to connect the system to our database and front end. The implementation is made by NodeMCU microcontroller and arduino. This microcontroller is able to connect with PC remotely, in our project, it uses WI-FI to make communication with PC. With the firebase libaray installed on Arudino, The message will be sent through this microcontroller with I2C protocal to the firebase real-time database of our project. 

The message sending to users contains the result done by Raccoon Lock which includes the sensor results, for example it sends the message about whether RaccoonLock detects human or Raccoons together with its detection time. The battary status will Also be sent to the database and let the user know when to change battary.
